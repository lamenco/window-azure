                    <p>Kömmerling 70 mm is a 5-chamber system with 70 mm construction depth for the production of
                        plastic windows. The specific technical feature here is the innovative, steel reinforcement with
                        patented geometry with extremely good thermal insulation properties. <br>

                        With its numerous geometries of crates, wings, campfers and flying dividers, the system offers
                        an almost unlimited field for architectural fantasy.<br>

                        It meets the highest requirements in terms of heat and noise insulation. The fittings installed
                        in the profile system and wrapped in the reinforcement offer a high degree of basic
                        anti-burglary. The levels of anti-burglary of class 1 and class 2 are reached without any
                        problems.<br>

                        The system is also an example in terms of environmental friendliness: As a first world-renowned
                        manufacturer, the KÖMMERLING brand, in parallel with recycled material, began to include in its
                        production process exclusively and only fresh lead-free PVC with "green" calcium-zinc-based
                        stabilizers.<br>
